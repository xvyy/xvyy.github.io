## Abstract
Estimating 3D human pose from a single image is a challenging task. This work attempts to address the uncertainty oflifting the detected 2D joints to the 3D space by introducing an intermediate state-Part-Centric Heatmap Triplets (HEMlets), which shortens the gap between the 2D observation and the 3D interpretation. The HEMlets utilize three joint-heatmaps to represent the relative depth information of the end-joints for each skeletal body part. In our approach, a Convolutional Network (ConvNet) is first trained to predict HEMlets from the input image, followed by a volumetric joint-heatmap regression. We leverage on the integral operation to extract the joint locations from the volumetric heatmaps, guaranteeing end-to-end learning. Despite the simplicity of the network design, the quantitative comparisons show a significant performance improvement over the best-of-grade method (about 20% on Human3.6M). The proposed method naturally supports training with “in-the-wild” images, where only weakly-annotated relative depth information of skeletal joints is available. This fur- ther improves the generalization ability of our model, as validated by qualitative comparisons on outdoor images.


## Introduction

### Challenges
- Reasoning 3D human poses from a single image is very challenging due to the inherent ambiguities.
- Existing approaches have not achieved a good balance between representation efficiency and learning effectiveness.
- 3D capturing and manual labeling require a lot of efforts to obtain high-quality 3D annotations, making the training data extremely scarce.

### Merits
- Learning strategy. Decomposes a challenging 3D learning task into a sequence of easier sub-tasks with mixed intermediate supervisions: 2D joint detection and HEMlets learning.
- Representation power. HEMlets is based on 2D per-joint heatmaps, but extends them by a couple of additional heatmaps to encode local depth ordering in a dense per-pixel manner. 
- Simple yet effective. The proposed method features a simple network architecture design, and achieves state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation results.

## Method

### Overview of the HEMlets-based 3D pose estimation
![overview](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/14/ydDFsUpMuixVX1W.png)
(a) input RGB image 
(b) the 2D locations for the joints p and c 
(c) their relative depth relationship for each skeletal part pc into HEMlets
(d) output 3D human pose.
Input RGB image. The algorithm encodes the 2D locations for the jointspandc ,but also their relative depth relationship for each skeletal part `pc` into HEMlets. Output 3D human pose.

### 3D pose inference

The network architecture of our proposed approach. It consists of four major modules: (a) A ResNet-50 backbone for image feature extraction. (b) A ConvNet for image feature upsampling. (c) Another ConvNet for HEMlets learning and 2D joint detection. (d) A 3D pose regression module adopting a soft-argmax operation for 3D human pose estimation. (e) Details of the HEMlets learning module. “Feature concatenate” denotes concatenating the feature maps from the HEMlets learning branch and the upsampling branch together.

## Experiments

### Results and comparisons on Human3.6M

On average, HEMlets improve the 3D pose prediction accuracy by 20% than paper `Integral human pose regression`

### Results and comparisons on HumanEva-I
![Results on HumanEva-I](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/14/F9ywWL1Zj4NG2Hg.png)
Without using extra 2D datasets or pre-trained 2D detectors, HEMlets method still outperforms previous approaches on HumanEva-I．

### Results and comparisons on MPI-INF-3DHP
![Results on MPI-INF-3DHP](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/14/Ty4zdXAOgH3S6Bx.png)
HEMlets method outperforms all these methods with particularly large margins for the “Outdoor” and “Studio no GS” sequences.

## Ablation study

### Generalization

Qualitative results on different validation datasets: the first two columns are from the test dataset of 3DHP. The other columns are from Leeds Sports Pose (LSP). The HEMlets approach produces visually correct results even on challenging poses (last column).

## Conclusion
- Proposed a simple and highly effective HEMlets-based 3D pose estimation method from a single color image.
- Achieved accuracy improvement of about 20% over the best-of-grade method on the Human3.6M benchmark.
- Good generalization ability is also witnessed for the presented approach.
